# Github Math

Have you ever had trouble expressing mathematical ideas in a Github readme?

Have you ever become tired of typing `&frasl;`, `&lfloor;` or `&isin;`?

Well, don't you fret! Github has basic LaTeX style math encoding ability, and
this app will streamline the process of going from something like `x = \frac{-b
\pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}` to ![x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 -
4ac}}{2a}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B-b%20%5Cpm%20%5Csqrt%7Bb%5E2%20-%204ac%7D%7D%7B2a%7D)
in no time.

## Usage

1. Open the [app](https://shlappas.com/github-math/).

2. Enter some mathematics.

3. Get the url. This is what github uses to generate your image. <br> _**NB:**
   Clicking the preview image will add the url to your clipboard._

4. Use the url in an image in your readme. <br>This is as simple as `![alt](url)`.
